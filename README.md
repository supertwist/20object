__A Pragmatic Method for Learning Max/MSP and Max for Live__

I discovered Darwin Grosse's 20 Objects about a decade ago, and recently wanted to refresh my memory on some basic topic. It is one of the best tutorials I've ever encountered on ANY topic, and deeply inspired me. While the 20 Objects site is still live, the link to the actual chapters is no longer functional. It hadn't been updated since 2017, and Darwin passed away in 2022... it's such a useful tutorial that it shouldn't disappear to bit rot. I'm attempting to reconstruct from Wayback Machine and update it.

This is my first real attempt at using a repo, and making sense of GitHub. For that, a big shoutout to another great teacher, Dan Schiffman at [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/ "All aboard!!!"). His tutorial [GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) is awesome!
