## Course Introduction
This course outlines a new model for teaching (or self-learning) Cycling '74's Max. It offers a pragmatic approach that limits the needs for memorization and requires a lot of hands-on patching. We focus on 20 objects as bellwether examples of Max functions, adding "friend" and "related" objects to round out the programming experience.

This is an introductory course, so some MSP (audio) and Jitter (video) functions will be included when appropriate - but the Max event and processing system is our focus. This syllabus is a work-in-progress, so things will change quite often. If you have experience teaching from this syllabus, please let me know - I'd appreciate any comments, complaints or concerns.

*** Note: With the help of Andrea Mazzariello, this series is undergoing a bit of a facelift for Max 7. Please bear with us during the transition. ***
