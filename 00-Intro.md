## Course Introduction
This course outlines a new model for teaching (or self-learning) Cycling '74's Max. It offers a pragmatic approach that limits the needs for memorization and requires a lot of hands-on patching. We focus on 20 objects as bellwether examples of Max functions, adding "friend" and "related" objects to round out the programming experience.

This is an introductory course, so some MSP (audio) and Jitter (video) functions will be included when appropriate - but the Max event and processing system is our focus. This syllabus is a work-in-progress, so things will change quite often. If you have experience teaching from this syllabus, please let me know - I'd appreciate any comments, complaints or concerns.

___Note: With the help of Andrea Mazzariello, this series is undergoing a bit of a facelift for Max 7. Please bear with us during the transition.___

## Things you should have available
Since we stay focused on Max programming, there isn't a lot of software that will be required for using this course. Most importantly, you will need a working copy of Max/MSP/Jitter; you can download a 30-day trial from here, with discounted versions available for students. Other than Max, you won't need any specific software. This coursework is system-agnostic, so you can be using either the Mac or Windows operating system without concern. This course is also as usable with Max for Live as it is for the standalone Max program, so having both Live and Max for Live is an option.

Hardware requirements are slightly greater, since we will be playing with device input in a variety of ways. In addition to your computer, you will want to have some sort of MIDI input device (preferably a keyboard). Perhaps the most important bit of hardware to have is a monitor that you are comfortable with and that provides plenty of screen real estate. As a visual programming language, Max needs room for its patches to spread out.
